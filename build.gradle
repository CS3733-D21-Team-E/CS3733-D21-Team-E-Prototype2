//What is this? This is your build.gradle!

//This is  a useful file which will help you manage running and building your application

/*Rather than run the app straight through Intelli J, you will always want to be looking
 * for the Gradle Tab on the right hand side of the IDE. This will allow you
 * to run Gradle Tasks, rather than just IntelliJ functions. It may seem complicated now,
 * but this will save you a lot of headaches as your app gains dependencies and needs to
 * be built in more complicated ways.
